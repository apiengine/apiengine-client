				<h1>ApiDocco - Beta</h1>
				<p>ApiDocco is a web app built as a tool to significantly aid your applications RESTful API development.</p>
				<p>The goal is to build a platform that allows developers to take their API to the next level with the following planned features</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Public API docs for developers and Private API docs for your own developers</li>
					<li>Comments and notifications on individual API request</li>
					<li>Automatically generate forms so developers can test your API on the fly!</li>
					<li>Easily setup a mock server on ApiDoccos servers to simulate your own API</li>
					<li>Test against your server against your API schema using the ApiDocco API</li>
					<li>Explore other API's and enjoy a centralized API documentation format.</li>
					<li>Easily categorize Methods into logical groups.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Check out ApiDoccos public <a href="#/apis/1">API</a></p>
			<p><em>This is a concept mock up and will be fleshing out the most desired features from above as we go</em></p>
			<p>ApiDocco's client side is open sourced and can be viewed on github. Currently it is hosted on Github Pages so what you see is what you get. Feel free to fork and fix the horrendus styles.</p>

			<p>ApiDocco currently has a remote database which is slowing everything down quite a lot. Organizing a better setup asap.</p>
			<p>Built with Node.js, Backbone.js and Mysql</p>
